# DRiP: Doing Research in Public

Two years ago, I wrote [this post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/agata-branczyk_research-opensource-openscience-activity-6843530675270877184-L1un/) about how I wish we wrote papers the way we wrote open-source code. Take a look at it first, especially the discussion in the comments. 

The idea of GitHub for science/academic research has been proposed before (see e.g. [vonMuhlen2011](https://marciovm.com/i-want-a-github-of-science.html) and [Banks2017](https://slate.com/technology/2017/04/we-need-a-github-for-academic-research.html)) but there the focus was on the value of sharing the output of scientifc research in an open way. My focus is on the _process_ of collaboration that is enabled by GitHub and collaborative software development best practices. This is what I want to adapt to scientific research. 

To some extent, this can be thought of as applying agile methodologies to the research process. But since research is already super agile, the methodologies would work in the reverse direction, making research more streamlined. Some of my early thoughts on this can be found [in this post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/agata-branczyk_quantumcomputing-agile-scrum-activity-6745019811497070593-cDp5). 

Why do I want to do this? I believe there is untapped potential in the gap between professional science and citizen science; I call this space _densizen science_. To tap into this potential, we need a framework that allows professional scientists, ex-scientists, independent researchers, up-and-coming talent without access to mentorship, (and others...), a framework for effective scientific collaboration, that does not rely on pre-established scientific networks, where each person can contribute according to their abilities. This is what is enabled by the _process_ of collaborative software development, as practiced in the open source software community. 

In this repo, I'm fleshing out some ideas for how such an effort could work in practice. 

#### What we need:
- An overview of the effort
- A list of related efforts and where they overlap/differ
   - OOSci
   - Networked science (Michael Nielsen)
   - Open science
   - Meta science/research
- An organizing committee that makes decisions (look into how leadership/governance is done in OSS)
- A discord channel for discussion 
- A bank of sources from which to draw open scientific problems:
  - Whitepapers
  - Talks
- Some instructions for how to find sources of open problems and add them to the bank
- A bank of well-posed scientific questions
- Instructions for how to convert open problems to well-posed scientific questions
- A bank of well-articulated shared praxes for different fields/disciplines 
- Criteria for what makes a shared praxis good and instructions for how to adapt it to your needs 
- A template repo for starting a project 
- Set of best practices for collaboration 
- Onboarding material:
  - Reinventing Discovery by Michael Nielsen
  - Relevant OSS contribution material 
- Contributor archetypes to help guide contributors to where they can contribute best
- Best practices for a collaboration marketplace
  - using stack exchange for research questions?
- FAQ
- Code of conduct
- Glossary of terms
    - shared praxis
    - open source software
    - open source science
    - networked science
    - collaboration marketplace
