# DRIP: Doing Research in Public

Two years ago, I wrote [this post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/agata-branczyk_research-opensource-openscience-activity-6843530675270877184-L1un/) about how I wish we wrote papers the way we wrote open-source code. Take a look at it first, especially the discussion in the comments. 

In this repo, I'm fleshing out some ideas for how such an effort could work in practice. 

#### What we need:
- An overview of the effort
- A list of related efforts and where they overlap/differ
   - OOSci
   - Networked science (Michael Nielsen)
   - Open science
   - Meta science/research
- An organizing committee that makes decisions (look into how leadership/governance is done in OSS)
- A discord channel for discussion 
- A bank of sources from which to draw open scientific problems:
  - Whitepapers
  - Talks
- Some instructions for how to find sources of open problems and add them to the bank
- A bank of well-posed scientific questions
- Instructions for how to convert open problems to well-posed scientific questions
- A bank of well-articulated shared praxes for different fields/disciplines 
- Criteria for what makes a shared praxis good and instructions for how to adapt it to your needs 
- A template repo for starting a project 
- Set of best practices for collaboration 
- Onboarding material:
  - Reinventing Discovery by Michael Nielsen
  - Relevant OSS contribution material 
- Contributor archetypes to help guide contributors to where they can contribute best
- Best practices for a collaboration marketplace
  - using stack exchange for research questions?
- FAQ
- Code of conduct
- Glossary of terms
    - shared praxis
    - open source software
    - open source science
    - networked science
    - collaboration marketplace
